Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have become the backbone of critical infrastructure such as smart grids, industrial control systems, and healthcare technologies. However, the integration of physical processes with digital communication networks has introduced complex cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This paper proposes a machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that leverages artificial intelligence to detect abnormal traffic patterns and potential cyber-attacks on CPS networks. Using a simulated CPS dataset, we trained a Random Forest classifier and developed a lightweight web-based tool using Flask. The tool enables real-time traffic analysis, offering a practical, ethical, and easily deployable security measure for CPS environments.
